Mechanical CAD

Goals:
- Free & easy
- Generate STEP files
- Import STEP files
- Editing STEP files
- Create simple assemblies (maybe with static joints)
- Create PDF drawings
- Measurement tools

Use cases:
- Create 3D models of electrical components for use in ECAD/EDA software (Altium in my case)
- Fitting PCBs in a case
